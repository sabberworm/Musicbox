Musicbox
--------------

Cappuccino Web-app with a node.js backend that lets users vote on tracks to listen to and automatically spawns raop_play (or another streaming player) with the next top-voted track.

## Requirements
- node.js
- npm packages
	- connect
	- yaml
	- mongodb
	- finder
- One of the supported players:
	- raop_play (needs faad for aac, mpg321 for mp3, vorbis-tools for ogg)
		- libssl
		- libssl-dev
		- libfltk1.1-dev
		- libfltk1.1c102
		- fluid,libglib2.0-dev
		- libsamplerate0
		- libsamplerate0-dev
		- libid3tag0
		- libid3tag0-dev
	- JustePort
	- Airfoil
- Metadata parser
	- AtomicParsley for mp4
	- mdls for mp4 or mp3
	- vorbis-tools for ogg


## Running

Clone or download Musicbox and `cd` to it.

    mv config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
    vi config/config.yaml
    node musicbox.js

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or whatever port you configured).

## TODO

### Web-App

- Use CPBrowser for the song browser.
- Username in Session w/o login if cookie still valid
- Error handling if response is not JSON should be more graceful
- When creating votes, the voting date has to be stored to be used when ordering with MIN()

### Player
In addition to roap_play (which has not been updated in quite a while), other backends should be configurable: JustePort, Airfoil (via osascript), etc.

## Known issues

- With raop_play
	- Playback sometimes stops shortly before the track ends ~10 seconds
	- Some MP3 files play at an extremely slow rate. Most likely mpg321â€™s fault. Filter those files or update to a working version.

## License
Except for the icons, which I had to buy, Musicbox is freely distributable under the terms of an MIT-style license.
