Todo
* Username in Session w/o login if cookie still valid
* Error handling if response is not JSON should be more graceful
* When creating votes, the voting date has to be stored to be used when ordering with MIN()

Known issues
* Playback sometimes stops shortly before the track ends ~10 seconds
* id3 indexing library is wonky to say the least but it’s the only one I could find that handles unicode chars gracefully
* CPTableView is an experimental version, column resizing, reordering is not yet implemented. The violet square on top of the vertical scroll bar is also an example of this.
* Some MP3 files play at an extremely slow rate. Most likely mpg321’s fault. Filter those files or update to a working version.
